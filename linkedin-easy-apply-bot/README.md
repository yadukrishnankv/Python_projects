🤖 LinkedIn Easy Apply Automation Tool

Automating repetitive job applications to enable focused interview preparation.

Job searching often involves repeatedly submitting applications through LinkedIn’s Easy Apply, which can be time-consuming and inefficient. This project is a Python-based automation tool designed to streamline that process by automatically applying to relevant job postings based on user-defined criteria such as job title and location.

The application leverages Selenium WebDriver for browser automation and Flask to provide a simple and user-friendly web interface for controlling the bot.
